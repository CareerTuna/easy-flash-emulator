This is quite simple to do.

1. Download the file either using zip or `git clone -i https://github.com/silvereengames/easy-flash-emulator.git`
2. Rename the folder `PUT_A_FOLDER_NAME` to a name of your choice
3. Rename your flash file you want to emulate to `main.swf`
4. Replace the existing `main.swf` with the new `main.swf` that you renamed
5. Make sure you are using a web server of some kind to run this or else it will not work.

Happy Emulating :)
